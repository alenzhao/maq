There are two ways to compile maq. The first way is to use the GNU
building systems. Simply type './configure; make; make install' to
compile and to install maq. Three executables 'maq', 'maq.pl' and
'farm-run.pl' will be copied to '/usr/local/bin' by default.

Alternatively, one could compile with 'make -f Makefile.generic' and
manually copy the three executables to the destination directory.
Modification to 'Makefile.generic' is sometimes needed for different
architectures.
